# Contributing to sbt-cxf-wsdl2java

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

* For important work (new features, major rework, non compatible update), start by creating an issue

For Pull-Requests: 
* please use the develop branch
* do different commits for different things
* don't change/upgrade the version in build.sbt
* it's not mandatory, but it's very nice when you add comments inside github PR interface for the most complex parts (this doesn't remove the need for classic comments in code)
